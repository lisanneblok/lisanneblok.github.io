        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>PhD researcher at the university of Cambridge as part of the AI4ER CDT. I am passionate about sea level rise and extreme events, demonstrated by the need to keep my house from flooding in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p> I use AI, mostly Graph Neural Networks and probabilistic ML to capture patterns in the sea level signal, to uncover correlations between causations of extreme sea level events on big and small scales. I aim to inform policy makers of the risks of the sea and am hoping to make a positive impact.</p>
